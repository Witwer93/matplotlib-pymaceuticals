# matplotlib-pymaceuticals

Homework 5 --- matplotlib

We were tasked with developing dataframes, bar graphs, boxplots, line graphs, and scatter charts. We were also asked to demonstrate calculating regression.
This assignment required us to employ our knowledge of pandas as matplotlib in order to finish it.

The biggest challenge I faced was dealing with outiers, boxplots and quartiles. I also struggled with using groupby().agg() as well as certain aspects
of constructing line graphs and scatter charts using a pandas dataframe.

It was clear after hours spent over the course of several days that I needed a better understanding of pandas to keep making progress.
I feel confident that I could easily produce the charts that I needed using matplotlib if I was better able to organize the data using pandas.

Another mistake I made was waiting too long to start in on this assignment. I was not only struggling to remember everything we learned about matplotlibs
but if I had started earlier I could've identified the parts of this assignment that I needed help with much sooner.

I do feel that I have a much better understanding of .groupby() after the last assignment I completed working with pandas and there are several other
pieces of this assignment that I completed with relative ease. However my experience with pandas and jupyter notebook continues to be a real challenge
as I often find myself working through the documentation for calling a function and then feeling lost when it does not work. 
It feels like I am spending far too much time online looking through past class activities, coding documentation and stackoverflow questions without making any real progress.

I know some of this is part of the process but it also kind of feels like I need to improve my approach to fiuring out why my code is throwing different exceptions.
I fully intend to get more help to finish this assignment.

As it is, my code is still relatively messy and lacking good comments, and it's missing the 3 conclusions drawn from the data/charts collected/created.
